This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

defineFunction.\n *\n * The first argument to defineFunction is a single name or a list of names.\n * All functions named in such a list will share a single implementation.\n *\n * Each declared function can have associated properties, which\n * include the following:\n *\n *  - numArgs: The number of arguments the function takes.\n *             If this is the only property, it can be passed as a number\n *             instead of an element of a properties object.\n *  - argTypes: (optional) An array corresponding to each argument of the\n *              function, giving the type of argument that should be parsed. Its\n *              length should be equal to `numArgs + numOptionalArgs`. Valid\n *              types:\n *               - \"size\": A size-like thing, such as \"1em\" or \"5ex\"\n *               - \"color\": An html color, like \"#abc\" or \"blue\"\n *               - \"original\": The same type as the environment that the\n *                             function being parsed is in (e.g. used for the\n *                             bodies of functions like \\color where the first\n *                             argument is special and the second argument is\n *                             parsed normally)\n *              Other possible types (probably shouldn't be used)\n *               - \"text\": Text-like (e.g. \\text)\n *               - \"math\": Normal math\n *              If undefined, this will be treated as an appropriate length\n *              array of \"original\" strings\n *  - greediness: (optional) The greediness of the function to use ungrouped\n *                arguments.\n *\n *                E.g. if you have an expression\n *                  \\sqrt \\frac 1 2\n *                since \\frac has greediness=2 vs \\sqrt's greediness=1, \\frac\n *                will use the two arguments '1' and '2' as its two arguments,\n *                then that whole function will be used as the argument to\n *                \\sqrt. On the other hand, the expressions\n *                  \\frac \\frac 1 2 3\n *                and\n *                  \\frac \\sqrt 1 2\n *                will fail because \\frac and \\frac have equal greediness\n *                and \\sqrt has a lower greediness than \\frac respectively. To\n *                make these parse, we would have to change them to:\n *                  \\frac {\\frac 1 2} 3\n *                and\n *                  \\frac {\\sqrt 1} 2\n *\n *                The default value is `1`\n *  - allowedInText: (optional) Whether or not the function is allowed inside\n *                   text mode (default false)\n *  - numOptionalArgs: (optional) The number of optional arguments the function\n *                     should parse. If the optional arguments aren't found,\n *                     `null` will be passed to the handler in their place.\n *                     (default 0)\n *  - infix: (optional) Must be true if the function is an infix operator.\n *\n * The last argument is that implementation, the handler for the function(s).\n * It is called to handle these functions and their arguments.\n * It receives two arguments:\n *  - context contains information and references provided by the parser\n *  - args is an array of arguments obtained from TeX input\n * The context contains the following properties:\n *  - funcName: the text (i.e. name) of the function, including \\\n *  - parser: the parser object\n *  - lexer: the lexer object\n *  - positions: the positions in the overall string of the function\n *               and the arguments.\n * The latter three should only be used to produce error messages.\n *\n * The function should return an object with the following keys:\n *  - type: The type of element that this is. This is then used in\n *          buildHTML/buildMathML to determine which function\n *          should be called to build this node into a DOM node\n * Any other data can be added to the object, which will be passed\n * in to the function in buildHTML/buildMathML as `group.value`.\n */\n\nfunction defineFunction(names, props, handler) {\n    if (typeof names === \"string\") {\n        names = [names];\n    }\n    if (typeof props === \"number\") {\n        props = { numArgs: props };\n    }\n    // Set default values of functions\n    var data = {\n        numArgs: props.numArgs,\n        argTypes: props.argTypes,\n        greediness: (props.greediness === undefined) ? 1 : props.greediness,\n        allowedInText: !!props.allowedInText,\n        numOptionalArgs: props.numOptionalArgs || 0,\n        infix: !!props.infix,\n        handler: handler\n    };\n    for (var i = 0; i < names.length; ++i) {\n        module.exports[names[i]] = data;\n    }\n}\n\n// Since the corresponding buildHTML/buildMathML function expects a\n// list of elements, we normalize for different kinds of arguments\nvar ordargument = function(arg) {\n    if (arg.type === \"ordgroup\") {\n        return arg.value;\n    } else {\n        return [arg];\n    }\n};\n\n// A normal square root\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\sqrt\", {\n    numArgs: 1,\n    numOptionalArgs: 1\n}, function(context, args) {\n    var index = args[0];\n    var body = args[1];\n    return {\n        type: \"sqrt\",\n        body: body,\n        index: index\n    };\n});\n\n// Non-mathy text, possibly in a font\nvar textFunctionStyles = {\n    \"\\\\text\": undefined, \"\\\\textrm\": \"mathrm\", \"\\\\textsf\": \"mathsf\",\n    \"\\\\texttt\": \"mathtt\", \"\\\\textnormal\": \"mathrm\", \"\\\\textbf\": \"mathbf\",\n    \"\\\\textit\": \"textit\"\n};\n\ndefineFunction([\n    \"\\\\text\", \"\\\\textrm\", \"\\\\textsf\", \"\\\\texttt\", \"\\\\textnormal\",\n    \"\\\\textbf\", \"\\\\textit\"\n], {\n    numArgs: 1,\n    argTypes: [\"text\"],\n    greediness: 2,\n    allowedInText: true\n}, function(context, args) {\n    var body = args[0];\n    return {\n        type: \"text\",\n        body: ordargument(body),\n        style: textFunctionStyles[context.funcName]\n    };\n});\n\n// A two-argument custom color\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\color\", {\n    numArgs: 2,\n    allowedInText: true,\n    greediness: 3,\n    argTypes: [\"color\", \"original\"]\n}, function(context, args) {\n    var color = args[0];\n    var body = args[1];\n    return {\n        type: \"color\",\n        color: color.value,\n        value: ordargument(body)\n    };\n});\n\n// An overline\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\overline\", {\n    numArgs: 1\n}, function(context, args) {\n    var body = args[0];\n    return {\n        type: \"overline\",\n        body: body\n    };\n});\n\n// An underline\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\underline\", {\n    numArgs: 1\n}, function(context, args) {\n    var body = args[0];\n    return {\n        type: \"underline\",\n        body: body\n    };\n});\n\n// A box of the width and height\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\rule\", {\n    numArgs: 2,\n    numOptionalArgs: 1,\n    argTypes: [\"size\", \"size\", \"size\"]\n}, function(context, args) {\n    var shift = args[0];\n    var width = args[1];\n    var height = args[2];\n    return {\n        type: \"rule\",\n        shift: shift && shift.value,\n        width: width.value,\n        height: height.value\n    };\n});\n\n// TODO: In TeX, \\mkern only accepts mu-units, and \\kern does not accept\n// mu-units.
